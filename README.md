## What Is ADHD?

ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is a medical condition. 
- A person with ADHD has differences in brain development and brain activity that affect attention, the ability to sit still, and self-control.
- ADHD can affect a child at school, at home, and in friendships.
- Sometimes parents and teachers notice signs of ADHD when a child is very young.
But it's normal for little kids to be distracted, restless, impatient, or impulsive â€” these things don't always mean that a child has ADHD.
